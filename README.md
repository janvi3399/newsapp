ABSTRACT
The problem that the news app aims to solve is the inconvenience and inefficiency of having to visit multiple news sources to access news from various countries and categories. This can be time-consuming and overwhelming, especially for individuals who want to stay up-to-date with current events across different regions and topics.
The news app provides a solution by aggregating news from multiple sources within a single screen, making it convenient for users to access news articles from different countries and categories in one place. Additionally, the app allows users to create a personal list of favorite news articles, enabling them to quickly and easily access these articles at any time.
Another challenge the app addresses is the difficulty in sharing news articles with others. With the email sharing feature, users can easily share their favorite news articles with acquaintances, colleagues, or friends, without having to copy and paste links or summaries manually.
By providing a streamlined and efficient way to access and share news articles, the news app aims to simplify the process of staying informed and up-to-date with current events, while also making it easier to share this information with others.
